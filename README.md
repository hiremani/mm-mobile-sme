# mm-mobile-sme

This is subject matter experts mobile application as part of Biomechanix Inc.'s MoveMentor platform. Please refer to backend at D:\code\projects\mm-backend-2, front end at D:\code\projects\mm-frontend and regular end-user mobile app at D:\code\projects\mm-mobile. Please read and understand the platform before implementation. Main role of the subject matter expert is to record the videos of himself/herself performing certain biomechanical/body movements, excercises and poses etc., they want to teach others to perform. They will be recording videos, annotating video for phases, editing phases if autogenerated, may have phasewise instructions etc. The subject matter expert should be able to perform these activities while being offline. Once online, app should be able to sync the data with server. Reference packages are typically generated in the backend The app should have all these functionality. Initially we will implement Android version. Later phases will do ios version as well. Currently web frontend funcctions is implemted for browser.
Study thoroughly the platform and generate the detailed PRDs covering all the aspects described above and design and architecture documentation
